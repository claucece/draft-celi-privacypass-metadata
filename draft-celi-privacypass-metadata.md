--- abstract

Privacy Pass is a protocol in which clients are allowed to receive
one-time-use anonymous tokens, using an issuance protocol, that can later
be used to anonymously authenticate themselves using a redemption protocol.

Certain instantiations of it may want public metadata to be cryptographically
bound to the issued token for different applications, such as prevention
against hoarding attacks. This document specifies how to add this public
metadata by using the PO-PRF construction.
